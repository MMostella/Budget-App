This is a application that I was inspired by Ramsey Solutions 'Every Dollar Application'.

As a budgetor, I enjoy doing simple and complex mathematics. So with that, combined with my love for web development, I am creating a fully functional budgeting application.

With user account creation and authentication. Each user will have a private tailored experience to take control of their daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, quarterly or even yearly expenses. Allowing them to track their bills down to the penny, so no extra money goes unused.

This is a starting application that I plan to eventually turn into a fully open app on the market.

This will be a full stack (frontend and backend) application planned, designed and built by myself (Mason Mostella).

Though is a work in progress, I plan to update this after every major addition to the project.
